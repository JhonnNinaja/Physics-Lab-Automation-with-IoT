## Physics Lab Automation with IoT

**Project Overview:**

This project aims to automate physics labs at the Universidad Cat√≥lica Boliviana "San Pablo" using IoT technologies.

**Description:**

The project involves developing Arduino and Raspberry Pi-based systems to automate physics lab experiments. Sensors will be used to capture real-time data and send it to a cloud database.

A web application will allow for remote monitoring and control of experiments, as well as visualization and analysis of the data.

**Videos:**
